WebIntLab
=========
This is our lab for **Human-Computer Interaction for the Web: Interaction Design and User Evaluation - Fall 2014** course at EURECOM Institute. In this project, we practiced HTML5, CSS and Javascript by building a simple homepage. 

HTML5's features
======
In this application, we used different kinds of features of HTML5. In particular, we used:

	* New structural constructs likes < nav >< header >< footer >< session > etc. to provide semantics for our webpage
	* Simple form: Each field is correctly typed so that, for example, the keyboard will automatically adapt on a mobile device
	* A map centered on your current geo-location with a simple form composed of a street, a city, a zip code and a country that is automatically filled with your current geo-location. The form should able to enter a different address that will center the previous map on this new address.
	* Video: you can change content of video by providing URL, jump to an offset in the video, rotate video, display or hide the default controls, mirror the video 
	* Video jukebox player, or in other words, a series of videos that will be played one after the other, like playing a channel in YouTube. The jukebox can contain only 3 or 4 videos.
