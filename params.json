{"name":"WEB-INT LAB","tagline":"","body":"WebIntLab\r\n=========\r\nThis is our lab for **Human-Computer Interaction for the Web: Interaction Design and User Evaluation - Fall 2014** course at EURECOM Institute. In this project, we practiced HTML5, CSS and Javascript by building a simple homepage. \r\n\r\nHTML5's features\r\n======\r\nIn this application, we used different kinds of features of HTML5. In particular, we used:\r\n\r\n- New structural constructs likes < nav >< header >< footer >< session > etc. to provide semantics for our webpage\r\n- Simple form: Each field is correctly typed so that, for example, the keyboard will automatically adapt on a mobile device\r\n- A map centered on your current geo-location with a simple form composed of a street, a city, a zip code and a country that is automatically filled with your current geo-location. The form should able to enter a different address that will center the previous map on this new address.\r\n- Video: you can change content of video by providing URL, jump to an offset in the video, rotate video, display or hide the default controls, mirror the video \r\n- Video jukebox player, or in other words, a series of videos that will be played one after the other, like playing a channel in YouTube. The jukebox can contain only 3 or 4 videos.\r\n\r\nIMAGES\r\n======\r\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dppqpdago/image/upload/v1443512359/1_akuqew.png\" width=\"97%\"></img>\r\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dppqpdago/image/upload/v1443512386/2_iqnoew.png\" width=\"97%\"></img>\r\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dppqpdago/image/upload/v1443512546/3_qyjdss.png\" width=\"97%\"></img>\r\n<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dppqpdago/image/upload/v1443512404/4_iw1jua.png\" width=\"97%\"></img>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
